This project presents an *end-to-end optimization model focusing on supply chain analytics*, developed and documented in a Jupyter Notebook. It leverages mathematical modeling and data-driven decision-making to solve real-world logistics and resource allocation problems.

## Dataset

**Source:** Supply chain CSVs (downloaded as archive from Kaggle or other platform, included in repository)

*Place the dataset (`archive (1).zip` or unpacked CSV) in your project folder.*

***

## Model Workflow

- **Data Import & Preprocessing**
  - Load, clean, and transform supply chain records
  - Visualize demand, cost, and distribution trends

- **Optimization Problem Formulation**
  - Define objectives: cost minimization, delivery time, inventory balance
  - Set up constraints (capacity, supply vs demand, warehouse limits)

- **Mathematical Modeling**
  - Linear programming model or other optimization approaches (`PuLP`, `SciPy.optimize`, etc.)

- **Solution & Visualization**
  - Solve for optimal allocation, routes, or inventory
  - Visualize outcomes: cost curves, allocation maps, summary tables

***

## Installation & Usage

**Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pulp (for optimization), scipy

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pulp scipy
```

**Steps**

1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Add the supply chain data to the project folder.
3. Run `jupyter_notebook.ipynb` to follow the analysis, model building, and solution.
4. Inspect outputs, analyze results, and experiment with assumptions.

## Results & Insights

- Optimal solution for resource/cost management in a supply chain scenario
- Visual breakdown of supply, demand, and transportation allocations
- Business recommendations based on data analytics and optimization results

***

## Next Steps

- Introduce more advanced optimization (e.g., Mixed Integer, multi-stage)
- Connect with real-time APIs or dashboards for supply chain management
- Test scalability with larger datasets, more constraints
